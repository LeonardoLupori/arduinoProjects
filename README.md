|Microcontroller|Teensy3.5|
|Code available|:heavy_check_mark:|
|3D files available|:x:|

a Teensy3.5 based apparatus for classical Pavlovian conditioning in water restricted animals. The setup features a piezo speaker, a  stepper motor controller and a capacitive lick sensor.
It can be controlled with a custom MATLAB GUI that also can record synchronized video data from a camera (e.g., for pupillometry or behavioral evaluation)
