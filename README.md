# Arduino projects
A collection of various projects, including code, hardware and 3D models to make life easier in a neuroscience Lab.

# Projects overview

## mouseHeatingPad

> Completeness: :yellow_heart::yellow_heart::yellow_heart::yellow_heart::white_heart:

3D-printable, Arduino-based heating pad for anesthetized mice. Small form factor heating pad to keep animals at a physiological temperature. Can be used for surgeries or for head-fixed experiments (e.g., two-photon recordings in anesthetized mice)

## cuedConditioning

a Teensy3.5 based apparatus for classical Pavlovian conditioning in water restricted animals. The setup features a piezo speaker, a  stepper motor controller and a capacitive lick sensor.
It can be controlled with a custom MATLAB GUI that also can record synchronized video data from a camera (e.g., for pupillometry or behavioral evaluation)
